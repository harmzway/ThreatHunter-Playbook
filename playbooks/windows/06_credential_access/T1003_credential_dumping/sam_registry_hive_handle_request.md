## Applies To

## Technical Description

Every computer that runs Windows has its own local domain; that is, it has an account database for accounts that are specific to that computer. Conceptually,this is an account database like any other with accounts, groups, SIDs, and so on. These are referred to as local accounts, local groups, and so on. Because computers typically do not trust each other for account information, these identities stay local to the computer on which they were created.

Adversaries might use tools like Mimikatz with `lsadump::sam` commands or scripts such as [Invoke-PowerDump](https://github.com/EmpireProject/Empire/blob/master/data/module_source/credentials/Invoke-PowerDump.ps1) to get the SysKey to decrypt Security Account Mannager (SAM) database entries (from registry or hive) and get NTLM, and sometimes LM hashes of local accounts passwords. In addition, adversaries can use the built-in Reg.exe utility to dump the SAM hive in order to crack it offline

Adversaries can calculate the Syskey by using RegOpenKeyEx/RegQueryInfoKey API calls to query the appropriate class info and values from the HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\JD, HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\Skew1, HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\GBG, and HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\Data keys.

## Permission Required

System

## Hypothesis

Adversaries might be accessing and decrypting SAM entries after calculating the SysKey

## Recommended Data Sources

| Event ID | Event Name | Log Provider | Audit Category | Audit Sub-Category | ATT&CK Data Source |
|---------|---------|----------|----------|---------|---------|
| [4656](https://github.com/Cyb3rWard0g/OSSEM/blob/master/data_dictionaries/windows/security/events/event-4656.md) | A handle to an object was requested | Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing | Object Access | Kernel Object | Windows Event Logs |

## Data Analytics

|| FP Rate | Source | Analytic Logic | Description |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|
| Medium | Security | SELECT `@timestamp`, computer_name, SubjectUserName, ProcessName, ObjectName, AccessMask FROM mordor_file WHERE channel = "Security" AND event_id = 4656 AND ObjectType = "Key" AND lower(ObjectName) LIKE "%sam" | Monitor for any handle requested for the SAM registry hive |

## False Positives

## Detection Blind Spots

## Hunter Notes

* An audit rule needs to be added to the SACL of the following key to monitor for ReadKey rights:
    * HKLM:\SAM
* Defenders can correlate known processes accessing those registry keys with events that tell you when the system boots up.
